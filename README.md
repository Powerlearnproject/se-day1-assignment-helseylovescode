#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.

Software engineering is the systematic application of engineering principles, methods and tools to develop and maintain high quality systems. 

It is responsible for creation of products, for this case software /programs, that make day to day tasks simpler and much easier for human beings who are in control of other living organisms, non-living too.

In the technology industry, it has helped created AI, Artificial Intelligence which includes but not limited to ChatGPT, Gemini, Copilot, POE, etc. AI has made a blow in a lot of fields not only the tech industry. Limiting myself to technology industry, tech companies use AI chatbots for efficient communication at any convenient time, foresee problems and even to troubleshoot them saving workers from the headache of solving each and every problem.

It has also helped in the creation of systems that monitor employees attendance especially in companies that have thousands of workers. Employers have been saved the hustle and bustle of working with large databases and filing systems. These systems are meant to be accurate and mostly effective.

Technology keeps on evolving and people keep learning new things and new products are formed therefore new job opportunities are created in the technology industry. This results to increase in the employment opportunities.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.


1945-1955 : THE EARLY YEARS OF COMPUTER PROGRAMMING
It was the advent of the development of first stored-program computers  and emergence of software engineering.

1956-1965 : BIRTH OF SOFTWARE ENGINEERING
Formalization of software engineering principles and practices. Structured programming methodologies and early software development models were developed.

1966-1975 : THE AGE OF SOFTWARE CRISIS
Recognition of the complexities and challenges of the large scale software development. Automated testing and documentation tools were introduced.


List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.

Phase 1 : REQUIREMENT GATHERING AND ANALYSIS
Create an overview of the project, determine requirements and set the product ground work.

Phase 2 : FEASIBILITY STUDY
Evaluate whether the requirements analysis aligns with the business goals and resources.

Phase 3 : PROTOTYPING AND DESIGN
Design the upcoming product i.e. architecture, security measures

Phase 4 : DEVELOPMENT
Translate the system design into source code and build the first version of the product.

Phase 5 : TESTING
Ensure the product has no bugs or exploits and is in line with the DDS expectations.

Phase 6: DEPLOYMENT
Push the new product into production by gradually phasing it into use.

Phase 7 : MAINTAINANCE
Keep the product safe and at optimal performance, plus occasionally add new features.


Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.

Agile methodology is more suitable for projects that are complex, uncertain, or rapidly changing while waterfall methodology is more suitable for projects that are well-defined and predictable.

In agile, deliverables and products are turned over throughout the project cycle not only at conclusion while in waterfall they are only delivered to stakeholders upon project completion.

Example : Agile is well suited for software development projects where the requirements are complex and may change frequently while waterfall is well suited for construction projects where process is definite and unlikely to change.

In agile, development is broken down into smaller, manageable chunks and the results are reviewed and improved upon in the next iteration (iterative) while in waterfall it is done in phases which are all distinct and each phase must be completed in order to proceed to the next one (linear).

Example : Agile can be used in new product development to quickly develop and test new products and to iterate on the design based on customer feedback while waterfall can be used in manufacturing where processes are stable and predictable.

In agile, planning and structure are highly fluid components that can shift and adjust as evolving situations demand while in waterfall, the project structure is laid out in detail before works begin.

Example : Agile can be used in research and development to explore new technologies and ideas and to develop prototypes while waterfall can be used in large scale projects that require high degree of planning and coordination.

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.

Software Developer- responsible for creating the software; front end developers work on the visible elements which humans interact with while back end developers work on the software’s functional engine.

Quality Assurance Engineer- monitors each stage of software development, debug them and define corrective measures.

Project Manager-  manages project progression, maintain stakeholder relationships , assigns tasks and ensures that the entire team stays on track.

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.

An IDE is a software application that helps programmers develop software codes efficiently by combining capabilities such as software editing, building, testing and packaging. Examples include Visual Studio, Eclipse and NetBeans.

A VCS tracks changes to a file or set of files overtime so that a programmer does not have to manage file versions manually or with custom automation scripts. Examples are Helix Core, Git, Mercurial and Bitbucket.

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.

Rapid evolution of  technologies- embrace continuous learning by ongoing education, attending conferences and taking short courses.

Burnout and stress- encourage breaks, provide support and resources for mental health and foster a culture of work-life integration.

Timelines and deadlines- establish clear priorities, break down tasks into smaller chunks and use time-tracking tools to gauge progress.

Testing and validation of software’s performance can be time-consuming and costly- write tests before implementing code to ensure reliability and early detection of issues.

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.

Unit Testing: commonly performed early in the development process by engineers themselves to ensure code is developed correctly. It is aimed at examining  every single unit of a software system in order to make sire that it meets original requirements and functions as expected.

Integration Testing: aimed at detecting flaws in the interactions between units within a module.

System Testing: serves to verify the product’s compliance with the functional and technical requirements and overall quality standards.

Acceptance: last stage of testing process that ensures customers’ expectations are met, verifying acceptance tests on the stories and features. It helps the team decide if the product is ready for delivery.

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.

Prompt engineering is the process where one guides generative artificial intelligence (generative AI) solutions to generate desired outputs. 

Importance
Accuracy and Relevance:
Prompt engineering allows users to provide specific instructions and context, ensuring that the AI model understands the task and generates accurate and relevant responses

Creativity and Innovation:
Prompt engineering provides users with a level of control that enables them to experiment with different ideas and explore the creative potential of AI models.

User Experience:
Well-crafted prompts enhance the user experience by making interactions with AI models more intuitive, natural, and interactive.

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.

VAGUE PROPMT: Tell me about climate change.

IMPROVED: Draft an informative article on the impact of climate change on biodiversity. Cover key topics such as habitat loss, species extinction and conservation efforts. The tone should be formal and objective; suitable for an academic journal.

It is more effective because it is specific thus gives AI enough guidance on what specific aspects to cover and the mode of delivery (concise).
