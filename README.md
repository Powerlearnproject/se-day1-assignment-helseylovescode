Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.

Software engineering is the systematic application of engineering principles, methods and tools to develop and maintain high quality systems. 

It is responsible for creation of products, for this case software /programs, that make day to day tasks simpler and much easier for human beings who are in control of other living organisms, non-living too.

In the technology industry, it has helped created AI, Artificial Intelligence which includes but not limited to ChatGPT, Gemini, Copilot, POE, etc. AI has made a blow in a lot of fields not only the tech industry. Limiting myself to technology industry, tech companies use AI chatbots for efficient communication at any convenient time, foresee problems and even to troubleshoot them saving workers from the headache of solving each and every problem.

It has also helped in the creation of systems that monitor employees attendance especially in companies that have thousands of workers. Employers have been saved the hustle and bustle of working with large databases and filing systems. These systems are meant to be accurate and mostly effective.

Technology keeps on evolving and people keep learning new things and new products are formed therefore new job opportunities are created in the technology industry. This results to increase in the employment opportunities.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.


List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.


Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.


Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.


Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.


What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.


Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.


#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.


Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
